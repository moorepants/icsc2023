  abstract = {A bicycle with a gyroscopic stabilisation capable of autonomous motion along a straight line as well as along a curve is described. The stabilisation unit consists of two coupled gyroscopes spinning in opposite directions. It makes use of a gyroscopic torque due to the precession of gyroscopes. This torque counteracts the destabilising torque due to gravity forces. The control law of the actuator drive making the gyroscopes to process is described.},

  abstract = {Fully enclosed motorcycles could form the basis for extremely fuel and space efficient vehicles, but their inherent instability upon encountering even a momentary loss of traction renders them unsuitable for general use. It will be shown that a relatively simple tilt control system using a gyroscope to provide a tilt control moment is capable of stabilizing the vehicle at still stand or at speed on a very low traction surface. Furthermore, the system can achieve a coordinated turn on high traction surfaces. Since the gyro is an energy storage device, it can be used also in a hybrid system to provide extra power for acceleration and to recover some energy during braking. This relatively old idea should be reconsidered in light of the improved electromechanical devices, which have been developed recently for hybrid electric vehicles.}

  abstract = {The mathematical model which has been developed to describe the dynamics of the motorcycle [1\textendash 5] has attained a rather complex configuration. Torsion of front and rear frames and lateral flexibilities are options which may be included. Tyre response to certain road irregularities is measured and mathematical models to describe this particular behaviour are being developed. As to the validation of the mathematical motorcycle model it was argued that the commonly performed road tests suffer from disturbances originating from the human rider which are difficult to measure or to control. For that reason a Rider Robot has been developed which replaces the human rider. Each of these three subjects will be discussed in the following chapters.},
